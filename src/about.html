        <p id="aboutMeText">Hello! I'm Rasul Sherimmatov, a front-end developer! I have strong passion about web developing! Well, I write a clean code and love problem-solving with entering code in JavaScript!!! <br> <br> Well, I have graduated INHA University, South Korea
            and currently I'm applying for jobs in order to achive my dream! Over the past months, I have realized that having a career in IT is one of my biggest goals! To be honest, I see magic in building websites! Working with designs and responsiveness,
            it is a joy to make websites which are user-friendly!!! <br><br> Up to this day of my life, I have been developing some small projects using the knowledge that I've been gaining. I am eager to learn new technologies day by day having responsibility
            to have an impact on the lives of people. In addition, I am capable of working with UI/UX! <br><br> Apart from my IT interests, I do calisthenics and enjoy spending some quality time with my family and friends in my free time )
